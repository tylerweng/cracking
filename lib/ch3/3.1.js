// Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks

// Can make an array where each stack consists of a portion of the
// full array % 3. Say for instance our array is
// [1, 10, 100, 2, 20, 200]
// The first stack would be the array values where index % 3 == 0
// so indices 0 & 3 -> [1, 2], second [10, 20] third [100, 200]
